# syllabus {#history}


As in the rest of the work, moving pictures have long marveled Latin America.
In what was most certainly the first demonstration of  "moving pictures" south
of the Rio Bravo, the [Lumiére
brothers](http://www.earlycinema.com/pioneers/lumiere_bio.html) showed then
Mexican President Porfirio Diaz their [early films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nj0vEO4Q6s)
in Chapultepec Castle in 1896. As moving picture technology spread through out the world, including
Latin America, it radically altered how individuals and groups in the region
perceived of themselves, and were represented by others. Film (and later
television) has been a source of enjoyment, a powerful propaganda tool, a
medium of artistic expression, and driving force of national identity. 

In this class we will focus on films that portray the history of early Spanish 
America as complex indigenous societies were flourished, were conquered by
Iberian empires, and developed into new colonial societies of Europeans, and
creole, afro-descendent, and indigenous peoples. How has the popular cinema
industry portrayed the colonial period in Latin American history? We will watch
and analyze films from the United States and Latin America that grapples with
various aspects of Latin American society before, during, and after the Iberian
conquests of the Americas. Through these films, we will both critically analyze
their historical content, as well as the assumptions and ideological
perspectives that go into the making of films on this period of Latin American
history.

Most films will be in Spanish with English subtitles. The majority of the films are rated R for strong language, violence, and/or sexual content. These topics (sex and violence) are not the main topic of the films, but are used to convey the struggles and reality of much of the colonial period, but also of contemporary struggle in the twentieth century in, for example, the Central American revolutions. In class we will discuss at length the themes that go beyond the uninformed viewer’s interpretation of the film. If, however, you feel uncomfortable with these topics please come speak to me.

# policies {#history}


![](http://chadblack.net/511S2012/media/images/disability.png) Qualified
students with disabilities needing appropriate academic adjustments should
contact me as soon as possible to ensure that your needs are met in a timely
manner with appropriate documentation.

**Attendance:** Attendance at all class sessions is mandatory. We only meet
once a week. If you miss one class, you've missed an entire week of class.
Viewing and discussion of films, group editing work, etc. that is done in class
is indispensable to success in this class. If you will not be able to attend
class, please contact me ahead of time.

**Deadlines:** Assignments must be emailed to the instructor no later than the
beginning of class on the day they are due, or at some other specified time
established by the professor. It is important to be technologically savvy in
today’s world. Much of our communication occurs through email, including the
sharing of documents and other work product. Late papers will not be accepted
for any reason without prior arrangement. This includes technology problems.
You’re responsible for attaching your work correctly and sending it in on time.

**Cell Phones and Laptops:** Please silence our cell phones prior to class.
Please do not text during class. Laptops are allowed only for tasks that require
them. In other words, plan to have paper with you. Based on the prevailing
literature, hand note-taking-- both while reading and in class-- leads to
substantially better educational outcomes. You are not required to have a laptop
in class, so feel free to leave it at home. During film viewing, no laptops or
glowing screens can be open. If, however, you have compelling reasons to use
your laptop for notetaking, particularly during films, consider sitting at the
back in order to prevent your screen's glow from distracting others. 

**Office Hours**: Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me outside of
class. The advantages of talking with me include: extra help on an assignment
or preparation for an exam; clarification of materials covered in lecture,
discussion of my comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses.
I am available during office hours on a first-come, first-served basis; if you
cannot come by during office hours, please contact me via email or phone and I
will be happy to set up an appointment with you.

**Changes:** I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester
progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations
and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you
to our class meetings. Or, keep up with it on the course website.
