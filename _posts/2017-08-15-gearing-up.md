As we rapidly approach the beginning of the Fall 2017 semester, I'm frantically putting the finishing touches on the course syllabus and website. Films and readings are chosen. Assignments are set. In addition to the site, a pdf version of the syllabus is available [here](images/syllabus.pdf), in case you prefer that form. I'm looking forward to an engaging semester of film, reading, discussion, and writing!
